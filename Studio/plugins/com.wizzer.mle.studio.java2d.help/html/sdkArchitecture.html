<h1>Magic Lantern SDK Architecture</h1>
<h2>Runtime Architecture</h2>
<p> The Magic Lantern Software Development Kit (SDK) consists of four major classes 
  of objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#actors">Actors</a><br>
    <br>
    Actors specify the platform-independent implementation of the behaviour and 
    interaction of each autonomous element in the title.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#roles">Roles</a><br>
    <br>
    Roles specify the implementation of each actor&#8217;s presentation for a 
    particular platform.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#sets">Sets</a><br>
    <br>
    Sets are resource managers that are usually specific to a particular type 
    of media, such as 3D, 2D, audio, etc.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="#stages">Stage</a><br>
    <br>
    A stage is a machine and operating system (OS) abstraction for sets that manage 
    shared resources and creates the entire frame presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p> Each object has a specific role in the execution of a title as each gains 
  control of the processor sequentially during each frame of execution. For maximum 
  efficiency, Magic Lantern objects are written in C++ and compiled to native 
  code. Magic Lantern objects may also be written in Java for Java-based targets 
  (e.g. OCAP or DVB-MHP). New functionality is added through subclassing and composition. 
  For simplicity and efficiency, Magic Lantern classes use only single inheritance.</p>
<p>Figure 1.4.1 shows how the main Magic Lantern objects are related to each other.</p>

<h3>Actors<a name="actors"></a></h3>
<p> An actor is a simple C++ or Java object that is the basic unit of autonomous 
  action within a title. Actors implement the simulation and behavioral aspects 
  of a title element independent of its presentation. Actor code is intended to 
  be independent of the target platform. This makes it easier to develop a title 
  that is portable to multiple platforms.</p>
<p> Each actor usually has a crorresponding Role object, described below, that 
  is responsible for its presentation in the title. Figure 1.4.2 shows a view 
  of a Magic Lantern Actor with Behaviors in relationship to its Role.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/MLArchitectureFigure4.png" width="260" height="169"><br>
  <br>
  Figure 1.4.2: View of Magic Lantern Actor with Behaviors in relationship to 
  its Role</p>
<p>All the &#8220;characters&#8221; in a Magic Lantern title are actors. For example, 
  in a driving game, the car, the road, a tree alongside the road, and an on-coming 
  car are separate actors. In addition, sounds can be actors. Thus, the hum of 
  the car accelerating and the explosive sound of a crash could each be generated 
  by a different actor. Cameras for 3D scenes can also be actors that can have 
  behaviors, such as a following behavior. There can be some actors which may 
  have no visible or audible representation in a title. For example, actor objects 
  can function as database managers or collision detection managers.</p>
<h4>Components of an Actor</h4>
<p> An actor consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li> property and non-property member variables</li>
  <li> functions and initialization routines</li>
  <li> an actor definition file (a subset of a Digital Workprint)</li>
  <li> a reference to its role (if any)</li>
</ul>
<p> A Magic Lantern actor is compiled into a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) or Java 
  Jar package. This permits actors to be dynamically loaded into an executing 
  title in the authoring environment.</p>
<h5>Properties and Member Variables</h5>
<p> The internal state of an actor can be implemented as ordinary C++/Java member 
  variables. Some of these members can be exposed through the authoring tools; 
  these are called &#8220;properties&#8221; and they are designated in a special 
  way in the class implementation. Actor properties allow other members of the 
  title development team to edit the actor&#8217;s state in the Magic Lantern 
  tools without additional programming modifications. This can be particularly 
  useful to the team&#8217;s title designers and artists and can minimize requests 
  for iterative programming revisions. Team members can use properties to define 
  and test different physical characteristics and behavioral characteristics for 
  an actor. For example, a title designer can tune the performance of a vehicle 
  experimenting with various settings of its exposed acceleration property.</p>
<p> Different versions of media can be designated for an actor by establishing 
  &#8220;media references&#8221; as properties. A media reference is a pointer 
  to an outside media file, such as a graphics image or a sound file. Using media 
  reference properties, artists can use the Magic Lantern tools to independently 
  update actor media or adapt it for specific platforms.</p>
<p> Non-property members can be any data type supported by C++ or Java, while 
  property members are constrained to certain Magic Lantern data types. For ease 
  of programming for different platform math requirements, Magic Lantern defines 
  a special data type that can be compiled as either a floating-point value or 
  a fixed-point<br>
  value.</p>
<h5>Functions</h5>
<p> Actor member functions implement the various behaviors of the actor. Because 
  the object implementation is based on C++/Java, the actor programmer can define 
  any number of member functions. Each actor constructor mst be callable from 
  a class static function that expects a common constructor interface. These class 
  static functions are placed in a statically initialized table at runtime. Multple 
  constructors with different interfaces are permitted within Magic Lantern. There 
  must be, however, a constructor that has the noarguments interface (default 
  constructor).</p>
<p> There are also two initialization routines that are typically implemented 
  by an actor class. The first is a function called <em>initClass()</em>. Title 
  programmers write an initClass() procedure to register the actor class and properties 
  with the Magic Lantern tools. The tools call initClass() which then calls back 
  to registration functions within the tools. The initClass() function is compiled 
  out of the actor code for targeted titles.</p>
<p> The second initialization routine, which is optional, is called<em> init()</em>. 
  If an actor&#8217;s init function is present, Magic Lantern will call it after 
  the actor has been initialized from the DWP (during rehearsal) or the Playprint 
  (for targeted titles). This allows the actor to do instance-specific modification 
  of the property values that were set by the DWP or Digital Playprint.</p>
<h5>Actor Definition Files</h5>
<p> The actor definition file defines the various aspects of each actor for the 
  tools. The title programmer creates this actor definition file so that the actor 
  can be tested and modified in the tools. The actor definition file is in the 
  DWP format and is typically included in the title DWP files. It defines items 
  such as the actor property names and types, the location of the actor header 
  file and DSO, the actor parent, and so on. These files are not used in a targeted 
  title; they exist only for the sake of the authoring tools.</p>
<h5>Role Reference</h5>
<p> Roles are paired with actors to handle the actors&#8217; platform-dependent 
  presentation. The role is responsible for displaying the actor. Actors contain 
  a pointer to their role; this pointer can be used to access the role&#8217;s 
  API which the actor uses to push state changes over to it. As mentioned previously, 
  some actors do not have<br>
  roles.</p>
<h5>Property Carriers</h5>
<p> A property carrier is an object designed for communication between actors 
  and roles. Property carriers are specialized building blocks that carry out 
  actor requests by operating on role internals.</p>
<h3>Roles<a name="roles"></a></h3>
<p> Roles are the system components responsible for media delivery, such as 3D 
  rendering. As such, they are typically platform-dependent. Any given actor could 
  be paired with one specific role on the authoring workstation (e.g. Linux) yet 
  later be paired with a different role on a targeted platform (e.g Microsoft 
  XBox or Sony Playstation). For example, a Linux-based role might do 3D rendering 
  using an OpenGL library, whereas the PC-based role may use one of the commercially 
  available rendering libraries for the PC platform (e.g. DirectX, OpenGL).</p>
<p> Magic Lantern provides roles for 3D rendering and 2D rendering (images and 
  movies). Audio presentation is done by direct communication with the audio sets. 
  Current role classes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> MleRole (abstract base class)</li>
  <li> Mle2dRole</li>
  <li> Mle2dImageRole</li>
  <li> Mle3dRole</li>
</ul>
<p> Roles can also be constructed from scratch by programming in C++ or Java. 
  This approach is appropriate when the media being presented needs to be handled 
  in a special way, such as media-specific level-of-detail control.</p>
<p> As with actors, roles contain conditional compilation structures that accommodate 
  the compilation differences needed for either the rehearsal player or a targeted 
  title. For example, for rehearsal, roles contain additional memeber functions 
  used by the tools to provide hooks for placement, scaling, and orientation. 
  Since the tools do not exist in the targeted title, however, these functions 
  are not required for runtime title playback. Magic Lantern uses standard conditional 
  compilation techniques to achieve this runtime code<br>
  reduction.</p>
<h3>Sets<a name="sets"></a></h3>
<p> Sets provide services for their attached actors and roles and are usually 
  specific to a particular type of media: 3D, 2D, audio, etc. In general, they 
  can be thought of as resource managers, where a 3D set manages a shared scene-graph, 
  a 2D set manages layering of items in the frame buffer and an audio set manages 
  synchronizing on the hardware output device. Each set implements a specific 
  API that is used by the roles it manages.</p>
<p> The Set base class implements an initialization function and an <em>attach()</em> 
  function. The latter is used to attach roles to sets and its implementation 
  differs for each set type. Some sets need only maintain a collection of roles 
  that use its services, other sets need more structure, such as a hierarchy. 
  Sets may have more than one implementation, using different rendering libraries.</p>
<p>Sets used for graphics include a camera control API. The precise implementation 
  of this API is, of course, dependent o the particular rendering library it uses.</p>
<p> The following collection of set subclasses is provided by Magic Lantern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MleSet (abstract base class)</li>
  <li> Mle3dSet</li>
  <li> Mle2dSet</li>
  <li> MleMidiSet</li>
  <li> MleAudioSet</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stages<a name="stages"></a></h3>
<p> A stage is all the things that can potentially differ from platform to platform, 
  such as rendering, input, sound, physical modelling, proximity and collision 
  detection, and event handling. A stage refers to the collection of services 
  on the target platform. There are three stages that will initially be accessable 
  through the Magic Lantern tools: the Inventor stage, the DirectX stage and the 
  J2ME stage.</p>
<h2>Runtime Engine</h2>
<h3>Execution Model Overview<a name="executionModel"></a></h3>
<p> The execution model that contols the sequencing of Magic Lantern titles is 
  a cyclic process repeated once per frame. Each actor, role, set, and stage receives 
  control of the processor, in that order. By default, on each frame, all of the 
  actors execute before any of the roles; all of the roles execute before any 
  of the sets, etc. This scheduling order is not strict, however, since an actor 
  may explicitly pass control to its role and that role may explicitly pass control 
  to its set. Programmers can also reorder or augment the scheduling. The idea 
  behind tha actors-then-roles-then-sets-then-stage ordering is that first the 
  interactivity is computed (actors), then the presentation is computed (roles), 
  then the various resource controllers gain control (sets), then the entire frame 
  presentation is created (stage).<br>
  <br>
  Figure 1.4.3 shows the Magic Lantern execution model.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/MLArchitectureFigure5.png" width="615" height="681"><br>
  <br>
  Figure 1.4.3: Magic Lantern Execution Model</p>
<p>The implementation of the main loop of the title that causes this scheduling 
  behavior is dependent on the type of underlying support for scheduling provided 
  by the player platform operating system.</p>
<p>If the target system is completely event driven, then the scheduling of the 
  actors, roles, and sets must be triggered by a timer or user event, and the 
  callback for that event calls the Magic Lantern function scheduler to handle 
  running actors, roles, sets, and stage. Precisely how frames are cycled depends 
  on the system, but the effect must be to sequence main elements in the order 
  described above and then repeat that sequence for each frame.</p>
<p> If the target OS or monitor does not &#8220;own the main loop&#8221; then 
  the title main() must.</p>
<p> Pausing a title, as an example, can be implemented by scheduling a &#8216;Pause&#8217; 
  actor with a special phase of the scheduler and then using a different main 
  loop (or registering a different scheduling callback with the native OS).</p>
<h3>Title Start-up</h3>
<p> In runtime mode, the<em> main()</em> program is very simple and performs the 
  following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Initializes the global title environment structure.</li>
  <li> Loads the &#8220;boot group&#8221; - the start-up actor group (cast).</li>
  <li> Enters the main loop.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Actor Groups (Cast)</h3>
<p> A group is a collection of actors that is loaded into memory at the same time. 
  As the title progresses and the need for new collections of actors arises, new 
  groups can be loaded into memory.</p>
<p> Groups may contain actors that are associated with any number of sets. Upon 
  loading, if a required set does not exist, the loader code will create it. This 
  allows entire scenes within a title to be created in a single operation. As 
  an option, the caller to the group loader may supply a registry object that 
  will be filled with<br>
  references to all of the actors that were created when loading the group. These 
  references can later be used to delete the entire group of loaded actors.</p>
<p> Registries have other uses within the Magic Lantern system. A registry can 
  be used for coordinating the behaviors of actor collections. For instance, a 
  collection of actors that must respond to an external event might register themselves 
  with a particular registry. Then user-supplied code could traverse the registry 
  in response to that event.</p>
<h2>Behavior Packages</h2>
<p> A behavior refers to any procedural element that makes an actor move or otherwise 
  change state. Behaviors can be cyclic and predictable, such as pre-scripted 
  animations. Typically, however, the term behaviors in Magic Lantern is used 
  to describe lifelike and complex actions by actors such as improvising or reacting 
  to the environment.</p>
<p> Behavior packages are a suggested programming methodology in Magic Lantern 
  that enable title developers to implement actor behaviors. Magic Lantern real-time 
  behaviors will initially include a simple vehicle package that can be used for 
  flying or surface-bound objects, lifelike or mechanical actors.</p>
<p>Magic Lantern will provide sample behavior packages that can be used in conjunction 
  with one another and with custom written packages. For example, a realistic 
  simulation of flocking or herding behavior for a flock of seagulls or a group 
  of marathon runners could be achieved by combining the Separation, Alignment, 
  and Cohesion packages. The combination of these packages would result in a group 
  of actors moving in concert, yet each with an individual awareness of its position 
  in relation to other members of the group and the ability to adjust accordingly. 
  Each seagull or runner would be defined as a vehicle with the Vehicle package, 
  with the seagulls&#8217; package defining them as flying objects and the runners 
  packages specifying attachment to a surface (such as the ground).</p>
<p> Packages can also be combined to create complex unscripted behaviors for non-biological 
  title elements, such as planes and cars with realistic banking and acceleration 
  properties.</p>
<p> The sample behavioral packages in Magic Lantern focus on the movement of an 
  actor around its world, such as basic steering behaviors and collision avoidance, 
  detection and reaction models. Trajectory, not proximity to an object is the 
  most important criterion for obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p> Magic Lantern also will provide simple packages that title developers can 
  invoke from their own action selection layer, where the actor makes choices 
  between conflicting goals. For example, Magic Lantern will include a sample 
  MlePursuer actor which chooses at each frame whether its highest priority should 
  be<br>
  avoiding obstacles, maintaining separation, or pursuing the nearest MleWanderer 
  actor.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Actor Behavior</h3>
<p> An actor is the basic unit of action in a Magic Lantern title, and behaviors 
  are the implementation of that action. Behaviors are member functions that the 
  title programmer writes for each actor class and then invokes periodically. 
  Running the behavior functions gives the actor its autonomous behavior. Usually, 
  these behavior functions will run once per frame or once per simulation step, 
  if those rates are not coupled.</p>
<p> Title authors have the option of coding the entire behavior inside one function. 
  Or, the function can implement some of the functionality itself and it can call 
  library functions or other behavioral components to implement the remainder 
  of the functionality. These behavioral components may be other member functions 
  written for the actor. They may also be member functions of packages that are 
  attached to the actor.</p>
<h2>Digital Workprint (DWP)</h2>
<p> The Digital Workprint is a simple object system with containership relations 
  that has both an in-memory API and an ASCII file format. Items in the DWP are 
  instances of C++ classes derived from a DWP base class (<strong>MleWorkprintItem</strong>). 
  The base class defines the basic capabilities for all DWP items: identity, traversal, 
  structure editing, and input/output. DWP items include scenes, sets, groups, 
  actors, and properties as well as other resource and attribute specifications.</p>
<p> Title developers and third party developers can create new types of DWP items, 
  which can represent new kinds of resources and attributes, by subclassing existing 
  items. These new types are loaded as Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs) for recognition 
  by existing applications. The Title Outliner provides a view of a title&#8217;s 
  DWP items.</p>
