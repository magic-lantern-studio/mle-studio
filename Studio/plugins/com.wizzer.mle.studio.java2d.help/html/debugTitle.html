<h1>Debugging the Title</h1>
<p>The Java development toolkit (JDT) includes a debugger that enables you to 
  detect and diagnose errors in your programs running either locally or remotely.</p>
<p>The debugger allows you to control the execution of your program by setting 
  breakpoints, suspending launched programs, stepping through your code, and examining 
  the contents of variables.</p>
<p>The debugger has a client/server design so you can debug programs running remotely 
  on other systems in the network as well as programs running locally on your 
  workstation. The debug client runs inside the workbench on your workstation. 
  The debugger server runs on the same system as the program you want to debug. 
  This could be a program launched on your workstation (local debugging) or a 
  program started on a computer that is accessible through a network (remote debugging).</p>
<p>To debug a Magic Lantern Java2D title, you can use the Eclipse Java Debug Launch 
  Configuration. A debug launch configuration will be created for you when you 
  create a Run Launch Configuration (see <a href="executeTitle.html#Section_311">Creating 
  a Launch Configuration</a>). The debug launch configuration will run the Java 
  debugger on your title. To see the debug launch configuration that was generated 
  for you for <em>HelloWorld</em>, select &quot;<strong><em>Run-&gt;Debug Configurations...</em></strong>&quot; 
  from the main Eclipse menu bar.</p>

  <p class="noteText"><strong>Note</strong>: You will have to be either in the 
    Java or Debug perspecitve to see the Debug Configurations menu entry. The 
    Magic Lantern perspective does not yet provide a shortcut to launch title 
    applications.</p>

  title.</p>

</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;<em><strong>Debug</strong></em>&quot; from the launch configuration 
  will start a Java debug session. The title will run until a breakpoint is reached. 
  When the breakpoint is hit, execution is suspended, and you are asked whether 
  to open the Debug perspective. Click <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>. Notice that 
  the process is still active (not terminated) in the Debug view. Other threads 
  might still be running.</p>
<p>Figure 4.2 shows the Debug perspective with a breakpoint set in the <em>HelloWorld</em> 
  <strong>main()</strong> method.</p>
