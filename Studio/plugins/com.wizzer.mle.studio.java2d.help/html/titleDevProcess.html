<h1>Title Development Process</h1>
<p>Figure 1.2.1 shows the title development process using the Magic Lantern Authoring 
  System.</p>

  Figure 1.2.1: Title Development Process with Magic Lantern</p>
<p>Magic Lantern offers tools that support the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content Integration</li>
  <li>Rapid Development and Prototyping</li>
  <li> Title Layout and Tuning</li>
  <li>Debugging</li>
  <li> Targeting and Optimization</li>
  <li> Integrating and Creating &quot;in-house&quot; Tools</li>
</ul>
<h2> Content Integration</h2>
<p> Content creators can easily integrate diverse content elements into their 
  title using the Magic Lantern<br>
  supported data types. Magic Lantern supports files in multimedia formats for 
  3D models, geometry,<br>
  animation, 2D images, sound, and video. Magic Lantern offers very tight integration 
  with common<br>
  multimedia formats.</p>
<p> Supported file formats include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Image File Formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, RGB</li>
  <li> Audio File Formats: AIFF, WAV, MIDI</li>
  <li> Video File Formats: AVI, Quicktime</li>
  <li> 3D Geometry Formats: Alias | Wavefront, SoftImage, 3DMAX, SGI Inventor 
    and VRML 2.0</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rapid Development and Prototyping</h2>
<p> The performance capabilities of current PC and UNIX platforms in conjunction 
  with the Magic Lantern<br>
  architectural structure lend speed to prototyping and efficient title development. 
  Programmers can build<br>
  upon the support libraries to prototype title objects and save them to the DWP. 
  This means that Magic<br>
  Lantern prototypes are not &quot;disposable&quot; efforts that have to be thrown 
  out when title development begins in<br>
  earnest. Successful prototypes become the basis of the final title and can be 
  continuously improved.</p>
<h2>Title Layout and Tuning</h2>
<p> The Magic Lantern Authoring Tools make it easier for every member of the title 
  development team to do<br>
  title layout and tuning. The Scene Editor is used for composing interactive 
  worlds, navigating through<br>
  scenes, manipulating the objects in the scenes, and creating the DWP. Throughout 
  the development process,<br>
  titles-in-progress can be quickly viewed in the Rehearsal Player window and 
  edited on the fly to test new<br>
  ideas. This allows non-programming team members to interactively view and revise 
  artwork, scene layout,<br>
  and actor properties without assistance from the programming team.</p>
<h2>Simulation and Debugging</h2>
<p> The Magic Lantern Rehearsal Player can be attached to a debugger so that the 
  title can be run during the<br>
  debugging process. Targeted players can be tethered to platform-specific simulators 
  to test and debug a title in context of the<br>
  constraints implied by that platform. For example, an OCAP player can be tested 
  using an OCAP simulator.</p>
<h2>Targeting and Optimization</h2>
<p> The Magic Lantern targeting and optimization tools generate the auxiliary 
  runtime data structures that<br>
  accompany the title code for a specific target. This facilitates iterative testing 
  and optimization of the title on<br>
  the target platform. Title developers can target the title, test the performance, 
  and then, when necessary,<br>
  write code to optimize performance for the different targets. The Magic Lantern 
  targeting tools make it more<br>
  efficient to test the title at the earliest stages with the target audience 
  and iteratively modify the title<br>
  throughout development.</p>
<h2>Integrating and Creating &quot;in-house&quot; Tools</h2>
<p> Magic Lantern is being designed from the outset to be an easily extensible 
  system. This allows title<br>
  developers to use the Authoring Framework API to incorporate their own specialized 
  tools into the system.</p>
