<h1>Title Mastering Process</h1>
<p>The Magic Lantern targeting process is part of the development of an interactive 
  title. This process uses the title components and makes them playable on a specific 
  target, such as a PC running Windows DirectX, a game console or a set-top box.</p>
<p>The targeting process can be used during all phases of title development. At 
  the start of title development, it is used to prototype the title on the target, 
  to explore the development limits, and to view the media on the delivery platform. 
  As development progresses, the targeting process is necessary to help refine 
  the title, keeping it efficient. When the development is complete, targeting 
  is the final step in producing a platformspecific title that is ready to be 
  transferred to the distribution media.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Targeting Process</h2>
<p>The targeting process uses several programs that help prepare an interactive 
  title for its execution on its target device. The targeting process takes the 
  Digital Workprint (DWP) and its associated media assets as input and creates 
  three output products. These three principal products of the targeting process 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the Playprint<br>
    <br>
    The Digital Playprint contains compiled casts (groups of actors) and references 
    to translated media. It is<br>
    the platform representation of the DWP and the assets associated with an interactive 
    title.<br>
  </li>
  <li> the translated media<br>
    <br>
    The translated media is the associated title media assets translated to a 
    form appropriate for the target<br>
    platform.<br>
  </li>
  <li>the title executable<br>
    <br>
    The title executable is the executable program containing all of the title 
    logic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Targeting Process Steps</h2>
<p>There are several key steps in the targeting process. Title developers can 
  also bypass the default solution and implement their own custom scheme for each 
  step.</p>
<p> These are the key targeting process steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The title developer converts media to produce properly formatted media 
    files.</li>
  <li>The title developer generates a target Makefile or Ant script for building 
    a specific target Digital Playprint (a binary<br>
    file format that is accessed by the Magic Lantern Runtime Engine).</li>
  <li> Magic Lantern tools generate chunk files, which are restructured DWP information, 
    to create the Digital<br>
    Playprint. There are four types of chunk files: cast (group) chunk files, 
    media reference chunk files, scene chunk<br>
    files and set chunk files.</li>
  <li> Magic Lantern tools generate runtime look-up tables that contain pointers 
    to constructors for title elements.</li>
  <li> Magic Lantern tools produce the Digital Playprint file. As an intermediary 
    step, a Digital Playprint layout<br>
    script may be generated to drive the build process. Using the layout script, 
    the Playprint generation tool<br>
    copies the chunk files into a single binary file, the Digital Playprint.</li>
  <li>The title developer creates the executable title by compiling the authoring 
    code and the generated<br>
    targeting code and then linking it against the Magic Lantern Runtime libraries.</li>
  <li> The title developer generates the distribution media (such as a archive or target package) 
    with all title components placed in a
    format native to the target. This is the final step of the targeting process. 
    This step is currently performed outside of Magic Lantern.</li>
</ul>
<p> Figure 2.2.1 illustrates the major components of the targeting process. It 
  shows the steps outlined above and the flow of different key pieces of data.</p>

<h2>Digital Playprint Generation</h2>
<p>The Digital Playprint Script Interpreter (<em><strong>genppscript</strong></em>) 
  assembles the Digital Playprint from chunks stored in individual files. These 
  chunks are the compiled actor group chunk files (a cast), media reference chunk 
  files, scene chunk files and set chunk files. A Digital Playprint Generation 
  Script drives the Digital Playprint Script Interpreter. The language for the 
  script is TCL-based. It uses commands to lay out the actual Playprint. The Digital 
  Playprint Script Interpreter also generates primitives for converting symbolic 
  Rehearsal Player names into numeric runtime player names. It places these runtime 
  player names in files that must be compiled and linked against the Runtime Engine 
  SDK libraries.</p>
<p> The Digital Playprint Generation Script is created with the Digital Playprint 
  Script Generator tool that reads the Digital Workprint. The script may be customized 
  or replaceable by the title programmer.</p>
