<h1>Title Structure</h1>
<p>This document discusses the structure of a Magic Lantern title. It attempts 
  to identify some of the common coding elements of a title as well as encourage 
  best-practices that will facilitate software reuse and optimization.</p>
<p>Figure 2.1.1 shows the Eclipse Java Package Explorer displaying the Magic Lantern
  HelloWorld project created using the default template.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/titleStructureSimple.png" width="358" height="961"><br>
  <br>
  Figure 2.1.1: Default Title Template in Eclipse Package Explorer</p>
<p>The title is comprised of two source directories, <em><strong>gen</strong></em> 
  and <em><strong>src</strong></em>. The <em>gen</em> directory contains one package,
  <em><strong>com.wizzer</strong></em>. The <strong>R</strong> class in this package
  is generated by the Android ADT and contains references to the application resources
  specified in the <em><strong>res</strong></em> directory.
  The <em><strong>src</strong></em> directory contains two packages, <em><strong>com.wizzer</strong></em>
  and <em><strong>gen</strong></em>. The <em>com.wizzer</em> directory contains the application
  source for the default title template. The <em>gen</em> package contains 
  elements that were generated from the <em><strong>HelloWorld.dwp</strong></em> Digital 
  Workprint (located under the <em><strong>workprints</strong></em> directory.</p>
<p>The Referenced Libraries are the Java archives (JAR files) which provide functionality 
  and resources required by a Magic Lantern title. The core libraries make up 
  the Magic Lantern Software Development Kit, or SDK. The SDK includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>mlert.jar</strong> - The Magic Lantern Runtime Engine</li>
  <li><strong>mlmath.jar</strong> - A math library that provides support for vectors 
    and matrices</li>
  <li><strong>parts.jar</strong> - Utilities for Magic Lantern components (i.e. 
    actors, roles, sets, stages, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>actors.jar</strong> - Magic Lantern Actors</li>
  <li><strong>roles.jar</strong> - Magic Lantern Roles for the Android target platform</li>
  <li><strong>sets.jar</strong> - Magic Lantern Sets for the Android targe platform</li>
  <li><strong>stages.ja</strong>r - Magic Lantern Stages for the Android target 
    platform</li>
  <li><strong>mrefs.jar</strong> - Magic Lantern Media References</li>
  <li><strong>props.jar</strong> - Utilities for actor and set properties</li>
</ul>
<h2>Title Digital Workprint</h2>
<p>The title's Digital Workprint can be found in the <em><strong>workprints</strong></em> 
  folder of the Magic Lantern Project. This is a convention used by the Wizzer 
  Works Magic Lantern templates and example source.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> <img src="images/genieLamp_48x48_32bit.png" width="48" height="48" class="noteImage"/> 
  <p class="noteText"><strong>Note</strong>: The Magic Lantern Project will currently 
    process all Digital Workprint files located in the project with the extension 
    <b>.dwp</b>. There is a known bug where the resulting mastered elements, such 
    as the chunk files, Java source and Digital Playprint, will not be correctly 
    constructed. For this reason, plan to use only one Digital Workprint file 
    per project.</p>
</div>
<p>The defatul template workprint is the simplest Digital Workprint that can be processed 
  by the Magic Lantern mastering tools. The Digital Workprint is an ASCII file
  where the first line in the file must be the comment</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
#DWP 1.0 ascii
</pre>
<p>The default template workprint contains a Stage, <b>MyStage</b>, for the Java 2D target 
  platform and an empty Set, called <b>2dSet</b> (see below). The Set is 640x480 pixels and is located 
  at position (0,0), relative to the Stage's coordinate system.</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
#DWP 1.0 ascii
( Include  $MLE_WORKPRINTS/parts/sets/java/workprints/MleAndroid2dSet.wpf )
( Stage +android MyStage Mle2dStage
  ( Set 2dSet Mle2dSet
    ( Property position MlVector2 0 0 )
    ( Property size MlVector2 640 480 )
  )
)
( Scene  scene1 MleScene
  ( Package  com.wizzer.mle.runtime.core )
  ( Group  group1 MleGroup
    ( Package com.wizzer.mle.runtime.core )
  )
)
</pre>
<p>The default template workprint contains one Scene, <b>scene1</b>, encapsulating a Group 
  with no Actors. The name of the Group is <b>group1</b>. This workprint is analogous 
  to a theatrical stage where the set is empty and no performers/actors are present.</p>
<p>The default template workprint is using parts provided by the Magic Lantern SDK. The 
  Stage is of type <em>Mle2dStage</em> which is included in the <em>stages.jar</em> 
  archive. The Set is of type <em>Mle2dSet</em> which is included in the <em>sets.jar</em> 
  archive. The Set is defined in the <em>MleAndroid2DSet.wpf</em> file. The <strong>.wpf</strong> 
  file contains a digital workprint fragment that defines the properties of the 
  <em>Mle2dSet</em>. It is located in <em>$MLE_WORKPRINTS/parts/sets/android/workprints</em> 
  where <em>$MLE_WORKPRINTS</em> is an environment variable set by the Magic Lantern 
  Studio installation process. If you are using the default installation directory 
  for Magic Lantern Studio, the <em>$MLE_WORKPRINTS</em> will be set to <strong>C:\Program 
  Files\WizzerWorks\MagicLanternAndroidStudio</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>MleAndroid2DSet.wpf</em> workprint is specifed as follows</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
#DWP 1.0 ascii 
( SetDef Mle2dSet
  ( Package com.wizzer.mle.parts.sets )
  ( PropertyDef position MlVector2 )
  ( PropertyDef size MlVector2 )
)
</pre>
<p>The <em>Mle2dSet</em> is a class found in the <strong>com.wizzer.mle.parts.sets</strong> 
  package. The set contains two properties, <strong>position</strong> and <strong>size</strong>. 
  Both properties are of type <em>MlVector2</em>, a class found in the <em>mlmath.jar</em> 
  archive. The <em>MleScene</em> and <em>MleGroup</em> classes are found in the 
  <strong>com.wizzer.mle.runtime.core</strong> package and are provided as part 
  of the <em>mlert.jar</em> archive.</p>
<div class="clearfix"> <img src="images/genieLamp_48x48_32bit.png" width="48" height="48" class="noteImage"/> 
  <p class="noteText"><strong>Note</strong>: The HelloWorld.dwp workprint may contain 
    a second Stage for the Magic Lantern Studio Rehearsal Player. The target mastering 
    tools do not process this DWP element at this time.</p>
</div>
<p>If you study the HelloWorld.dwp workprint closely, you will notice some of the 
  items contain a "<strong>+<em>tag</em></strong>" string (e.g. <em>+android</em> 
  and <em>+rehearsal</em>). These <strong>tags</strong> are used by the Magic 
  Lantern authoring and mastering tools to filter on DWP items while processing 
  the Digital Workprint. For the Android platform, the <em>+android</em> tag is 
  required for the Android Stage. All sub-items, like the Set, are also filtered 
  by the parent item's tag.</p>
<h2>Title Source</h2>
<p>The title source is found in the <strong>com.wizzer</strong> and <strong>gen</strong> 
  packages. The files are</p>
<ul>
  <li>com.wizzer.HelloWorldActivity.java</li>
  <li>com.wizzer.TitleData.java</li>
  <li>com.wizzer.TitleRegistry.java</li>
  <li>com.wizzer.R.java</li>
  <li>gen.ActorID.java</li>
  <li>gen.GroupID.java</li>
  <li>gen.SceneID.java</li>
  <li>gen.MleRuntimeTables.java</li>
  <li>gen.DppTOC.java</li>
</ul>
<p>These files will be fairly common across all Magic Lantern titles targeting 
  the Android platform.</p>
<p><em>HelloWoprldActivity.java</em> contains the main application entry points,
  <em>onCreate()</em>, <em>onStart()</em>, <em>onResume()</em>, <em>onPause()</em>,
  <em>onStop()</em> and <em>onDestroy()</em>. 
  It is responsible for intializing the title, starting the main loop of execution, 
  and cleaning up the title on exit.
<p><em>TitleData.java</em> implements a class for managing title specific data. 
  It holds a reference to the Digital Playprint, the playprint's table-of-contents, 
  and the Magic Lantern Runtime Engine tables. The table-of-contents, <em>DppTOC</em>, 
  and the runtime tables, <em>MleRuntimeTables</em>, are both generated during 
  the mastering process.</p>
<p>The <em>TitleRegistry</em> class manages a registry of Actors that are loaded 
  from the Digital Playprint. The <em>TitleRegistry</em> may also be used to track 
  Actors that are created dynamically during title execution.</p>
<p> The <em>R</em> class is generated by the Android ADT. The class will be created
  automatically when you make any change to an external resource file of folder.
  The <em>R</em> class contains static subclasses for each of the resource types
  for which you've defined at least one resource. Each of the subclasses within <em>R</em>
  exposes its associated resources as variables, with the variable names matching
  the resource identifiers - for example, <em>R.string.app_name</em> or
  <em>R.raw.playprint</em>.
<p>The <em>ActorID</em> class is generated when the Digital Workprint is mastered. 
  It contains a global index of the Actors in the title. The value of the index 
  is relative to the playprint's table-of-contents, <em>DppTOC</em>. The ActorID 
  class also maintains the Actor's index into the the Group it is associated with. 
  These indices may be used to traverse the Digital Playprint at runtime.</p>
<p>The <em>GroupID</em> class is also generated when the Digital Workprint is 
  mastered. This class contains definitions for mapping Group names to their position 
  in the global array of all groups.</p>
<p>The <em>SceneID</em> class is also a generated component. SceneID contains 
  definitions for mapping Scene names to a global integer constant. It also contains 
  definitions for mapping Group and Scene names to their position in the array 
  returned by the Runtime Engine utility, <em>MleDppLoader.mleLoadScene()</em>.</p>
<p><em>MleRuntimeTables.java</em> contains the mastered tables for accessing Actor 
  Types and their registered properties. It also contains tables for accessing 
  Role Types, Set Types, Set Instances and their registered properties. Finally, 
  the tables for accessing Group and Scene Types are also generated here. The 
  <em>MleRuntimeTables</em> class is essentially a dictionary of the Actor, Role, 
  Group and Set classes specified in the Digital Workprint.</p>
<p>The <em>DppTOC.java</em> file contains the static initializations for the global 
  symbols representing the Digital Playprint table of contents. The <em>DppTOC</em> 
  class is a map of the Digital Playprint layout.</p>
<h3>Title Initialization</h3>
<p>Title initialization involves initializing the platform specific data. For 
  the Android platform, the data is managed by the <em>MleJ2dPlatformData</em> 
  class. Platform data identifies resources such as the width and height of the 
  platform device. Title initialization also involves initializing the title registry 
  of parts. The registry will add itself as an Observer to the Magic Lantern Runtime 
  Engine <em>MleTables</em> class so that it will be notified when an Actor has 
  been loaded from the Digital Playprint. The title registery is managed by the 
  <em>com.wizzer.TitleRegistry</em> class.</p>
<p>After the title registry is initialized, the title loads the Digital Playprint. 
  The name of the playprint is extracted from the title specific data contained 
  in the <em>com.wizzer.TitleData</em> class.</p>
<p>The next step in title initialization involves creating an event dispatcher. 
  The event dispatcher, <em>MleEventDispatcher</em>, is used to process user events 
  such as mouse and key input. It may also be used to handle generic software 
  events generated by Actors.</p>
<p>The title is responsible for creating a scheduler and registering phases of 
  execution. The phases of execution are exercised in the title's main loop (see 
  &quot;<a href="sdkArchitecture.html#executionModel">Execution Model Overview</a>&quot; 
  for more information). By default, the Wizzer Works titles use six phases of 
  execution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Actor Phase - used to update Actor's behaviors</li>
  <li>Post-Actor Phase - used to modify title behavior based on previous Actor 
    updates </li>
  <li>Pre-Role Phase - used to initialize rendering behavior for all Roles</li>
  <li>Role Phase - used to render individual Roles</li>
  <li>Set Phase - used to render Set to Stage</li>
  <li>Stage Phase - used to render Stage to physical device</li>
</ol>
<p>After the scheduler has been primed, the title must create and initialize its 
  Stage.</p>
<p>The final step in title initialization is to load the first Scene from the 
  Digital Playprint. This step will populate the title with the first Group of 
  Actors. As the actors are loaded, their properties will be initialized with 
  static values retrieved from the Digital Playprint.</p>
<h3>Main Loop of Execution</h3>
<p>The main loop of execution is an infinite loop, dispatching pending events 
  and running the scheduled phases of execution. The loop will be broken when 
  an event occurs indicating that the application should exit.</p>
<h3>Title Clean Up</h3>
<p>Typically the title will clean up by properly disposing resources obtained 
  while executing the application. Unfortunately, the current Wizzer Works templates 
  do not yet follow this advice.</p>
<h2>Title Digital Playprint</h2>
<p>The Digital Playprint is a binary file that is consumed by the title at runtime. 
  The file is generated during the target mastering process and can be found in 
  the &quot;<em>src/gen</em>&quot; directory. The Magic Lantern Studio Project 
  is configured to master the Digital Workprint whenever it is modified by the 
  application developer. This feature is handled by the Eclipse Builders associated 
  with the project. Figure 2.1.2 shows the Builders for the default template.</p>
