<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Magic Lantern Android Studio. This tool may be used to create 
  applications for  Android devices using the Wizzer Works Magic Lantern platform. 
  Magic Lantern is a interactive, title development platform for authoring highly 
  interactive titles, such as interactive TV applications, games, educational 
  programs, and point-of-information/sales kiosks. It was created specifically 
  for the real-world needs of professional title development teams as they break 
  new ground in the development of real-time interactive titles.</p>
<p>The Magic Lantern authoring system was developed with an understanding of how 
  the top professional development teams are currently creating titles. It is 
  designed to streamline development and collaborative processes so that title 
  developers can focus on enhancing content, performance and interactivity. The 
  Magic Lantern development environment is being developed for the Windows and 
  UNIX workstation; for title playback, the Magic Lantern architecture facilitates 
  efficient deployment of a title to one or more platforms, such as an interactive 
  TV set-top box, a Pentium-based PC, or game console.</p>
<p> Magic Lantern is an Open Source project that can be found on SourceForge. 
  The project can be found at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-mle/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-mle/</a>. 
  Downloads can currently be obtained for the Windows XP platform.</p>
<p>The Magic Lantern architecture establishes a complete foundation for developing 
  high-performance interactive titles without restricting developers' ability 
  to customize title elements or processes. Its object-oriented design and extensible 
  tools framework encourages the incorporation of specialized add-ons and title 
  templates. </p>

<h3> Magic Lantern Authoring Tools</h3>
<p> The Magic Lantern Authoring Tools include the Scene Editor, the Rehearsal 
  Player, the Title Outliner, and the Actor Editor. These tools comprise the title 
  development interface for the entire development team, including programmers, 
  title designers and graphic artists. They allow title artists and designers 
  to view, tune, and change the title and the title elements without an extensive 
  knowledge of the underlying software. Changes that are made with the tools can 
  be saved directly to a <em><strong>Digital Workprint</strong></em> (DWP), the 
  Magic Lantern title specification file format, without compiling.</p>
<h3>Magic Lantern Authoring Framework</h3>
<p> The Magic Lantern Authoring Framework provides a layered architecture for 
  the Magic Lantern authoring tools and facilitates the creation of additional 
  custom windows and commands for the tools. Third-party tool providers can incorporate 
  specialized tools into the framework without needing a deep understanding of 
  the Magic Lantern software. The Magic Lantern Authoring Framework provides an 
  interface to the DWP, the Rehearsal Player, and the Magic Lantern core libraries.</p>
<h3>Magic Lantern Digital Workprint (DWP)</h3>
<p> The DWP is the Magic Lantern title specification file format that facilitates 
  title deployment to multiple platforms. The DWP specifies all the resources 
  that accompany a title and is a repository for saved information about the development 
  of a title. The DWP is designed to be an open standard and will eventually be 
  based on XML technology that can be extended by title developers and third-party 
  developers.</p>
<h3>Magic Lantern Runtime SDKs</h3>
<p> Magic Lantern includes C++ and Java classes and runtime libraries for a variety 
  of target platforms. These SDKs provide routines for I/O, audio, graphics rendering, 
  2D and 3D objects, applying kinematics, and math. In addition, behavioral libraries 
  are included for designing title element behaviors</p>
<h3>Magic Lantern Title Targeting and Optimization Tools</h3>
<p> The title targeting tools transform the DWP and associated code resources 
  into its executable version for a specific target platform. They include tools 
  for controlling the targeting process, media translation, color management, 
  and title compilation. The platform representation of the DWP and the title 
  assets is known as the <em><strong>Digital Playprint</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Title Development Process</h2>
<p>The Magic Lantern title development process supports content integration, rapid 
  development and prototyping, title layout and tuning, debugging, targeting and 
  optimization. More information can be found here, &quot;<a href="titleDevProcess.html">Title 
  Development Process</a>&quot;.</p>
