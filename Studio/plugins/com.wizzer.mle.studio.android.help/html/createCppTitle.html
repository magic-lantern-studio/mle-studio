<h1>3.0 Writing a Magic Lantern Title in C++</h1>
<p>You can create a title and add other actors to that title without using the 
  Magic Lantern Studio authoring tools. To do this, you will need to follow some 
  basic steps. You have to</p>
<ol>
  <li> create a DWP file, this sets up the title workprint</li>
  <li>define actor definition files, <em><strong>.wpa</strong></em> and <em><strong>.wpd</strong></em> 
    files</li>
  <li>set up a title build environment (i.e. makefile)</li>
  <li> write the necessary C++ code and include files </li>
</ol>
<h2>3.1 Understanding the Directory Structure<a name="section_3.1"></a></h2>
<p> It is important to understand the Magic Lantern directory structure because 
  you will need to locate the different runtime libraries and modules used by 
  your title, in addition to your own source code and media content files.The 
  Magic Lantern directory structure is as follows: </p>
<p>&lt;to be supplied&gt; </p>

<h2>3.3 Defining Actor Definition Files<a name="section_3.3"></a></h2>
<p>&lt;to be supplied&gt;</p>
<h2>3.4 Setting Up the Build Environment<a name="section_3.4"></a></h2>
<p>In order build a title outside the Magic Lantern Studio IDE, certain conventions 
  should be followed. This section discusses how to set up the build environment 
  targeting the C++ language.</p>
<h3>3.4.1 Setting Up the Title Makefile<a name="section_3.4.1"></a></h3>
<p>&lt;to be supplied&gt;</p>
<h3>3.4.2 Integrating with a Debugger<a name="section_3.4.2"></a></h3>
<p>You can integrate the Rehearsal Player with the dbx debugger by using the environmental 
  variable MLEDBX in your title makefile. This variable allows you to attach the 
  debugger to the Rehearsal Player window and then run the program in the debugger.</p>
<h2>3.5 Writing the Title in C++<a name="section_3.5"></a></h2>
<h3>3.5.1 Understanding the Main Program<a name="section_3.5.1"></a></h3>
<p> All titles begin with a main routine. Understanding this routine helps you 
  to understand the structure of a Magic Lantern title. In addition, you need 
  to understand the default main routine to write a custom main. </p>
<h4>3.5.1.1 Finding the Default Main<a name="section_3.5.1.1"></a></h4>
<p> Magic Lantern provides a default main routine, which resides in the player 
  library. Note that there are multiple player libraries: for example, there is 
  one for the Rehearsal Player and one for the Windows BRender Player. Each player 
  has its own default main routine. </p>
<p>For example, in the Rehearsal Player, the main routine is called <em><strong>mlplay</strong></em>. 
  <em>mlplay</em> consists of two pieces of source code: main.cxx and title.cxx. 
  In the Inventor Player, the title name itself is the main, and it is found in 
  the library <em>libplayer.a</em>. On the Windows BRender platform, the main 
  is found in the title's directory, in the main.cxx source code file. The associated 
  title.cxx source file is in the Magic Lantern library directory for the Windows 
  Player. </p>
<p>Note: On the Windows platform, there is a win32 set of directories and a game 
  developers kit set of directories. </p>
<p>You can find the main program in the main.cxx source file. The title.cxx source 
  file contains the implementations of the functions that are called by the main 
  program. </p>
<h4>3.5.1.2 The Default Main Program<a name="section_3.5.1.2"></a></h4>
<p>This section discusses the main entry points, or application lifecycle, of 
  a Magic Lantern title.</p>
<h5>3.5.1.2.1 Main Entry Points for C++<a name="section_3.5.1.2.1"></a></h5>
<p>The standard main program for a title is fairly simple. It allocates memory 
  for the required global variables and calls three functions, <em>InitEnv()</em>, 
  <em>MainLoop()</em>, and <em>CleanupEnv()</em>. </p>
<p><em>main()</em> calls <em>mlMalloc()</em> to allocate memory for the title 
  data structure. <em>mlMalloc()</em> by default is merely a Magic Lantern function 
  that calls system <em>malloc()</em>. This allows programmers to replace the 
  standard memory allocation routine with a custom implementation. </p>
<p>The file main.c++ looks like this: </p>
<p>Example 1-1: main program in C++</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    // Include Magic Lantern header files.
    #include &quot;mle/types.h&quot;
    #include &quot;mle/malloc.h&quot;
    #include &quot;mle/titleenv.h&quot;
    #include &quot;mle/assert.h&quot;

    // Declare external references.
    extern MlBoolean InitEnv(int, char **);
    extern int MainLoop(void);
    extern MlBoolean CleanupEnv(void);

    //
    // main()
    //
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        // Create a new title environment.
        theTitle = (MleTitleEnv*)mlMalloc(sizeof *theTitle);
        MLE_ASSERT(theTitle);
        // Initialize the title environment structure.
        InitEnv(argc, argv);
        // Start the main title loop.
        MainLoop();
        // Clean up the title environment.
        CleanupEnv();

        return(0);
    }
</pre>
<h5>3.5.1.2.2 Understanding the Principal Functions<a name="section_3.5.1.2.2"></a></h5>
<p> main calls three principal functions: </p>
<ul>
  <li> InitEnv</li>
  <li>MainLoop</li>
  <li>CleanupEnv </li>
</ul>
<p>These functions initialize the title, execute the main title loop, and clean 
  up when the title completes. You can find this code in title.cxx. They are explained 
  in this section. </p>
<h5>3.5.1.2.3 Title Data Structures<a name="section_3.5.1.2.3"></a></h5>
<p> Before examining the main functions, you should understand the titleenv.h 
  header file because it defines some important title data structures. </p>
<p>The struct <em><strong>MleTitleEnv</strong></em> contains global data for the 
  title, including pointers to the scheduler and the event dispatch manager. It 
  also defines the quit flag, the Digital Playprint reader, a pointer to data 
  specific to a target platform, and a pointer to global data specific to the 
  title. See Example 1-2. </p>
<p>Example 1-2: MleTitleEnv Structure </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    typedef struct MleTitleEnv
    {
        MleScheduler *scheduler;
        MleEventMgr *eventMgr;
        MlBoolean quit;     // quit flag
        MlePpInput *pp;     // playprint reader
        void* platformData; // target platform data
        void* titleData;    // title global data
    } MleTitleEnv;
</pre>
<p>titleenv.h also defines the enum <em><strong>MleTitlePhases</strong></em> for 
  the scheduler phases. This contains the names of the built-in, or default, phases. 
  If you create your own custom phase, you must add its name to <em>MleTitlePhases</em>. 
</p>
<p>Example 1-3: Scheduler Phase enum </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    typedef enum {
        PHASE_ACTOR,
        PHASE_ROLE,
        PHASE_SET,
        PHASE_STAGE,
        TOTAL_NUM_PHASES
    } MleTitlePhases;</pre>
<h4>3.5.1.2.4 Initializing the Title<a name="section_3.5.1.2.4"></a></h4>
<p> The <em>InitEnv()</em> function performs a number of important tasks. In the 
  Rehearsal Player, it locates, opens, and loads the DWP file into memory. On 
  the mastering side (the player platforms), it locates, open, and loads the Digital 
  Playprint file into memory. It allocates memory and then creates a new Playprint 
  object, as follows: </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    MlBoolean InitEnv(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        char *ppName;
        ...
        ppName = (char *) mlMalloc(strlen(argv[0]) + 4);
        ...
        theTitle-&gt;pp = new FwPpInput (ppName, MLE_PPFINDPPBE);
</pre>
<p>Note: The <strong>MLE_PPFINDPPBE</strong> constant is specific for Big Endian 
  boxes, where the order of significant bits is big endian. On the Windows platform, 
  this would be <strong>MLE_PPFINDPPLE</strong>, because the Intel hardware uses 
  little endian bit order. </p>
<p>Next, this function reads in the title components into the Playprint object: 
</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
        ... 
        theTitle-&gt;pp-&gt;readHeader(NULL, NULL);
        theTitle-&gt;pp-&gt;readTOC(MlePpInput::storeTOC,theTitle-&gt;pp);
        theTitle-&gt;pp-&gt;beginGroupList();
</pre>
<p><em>InitEnv()</em> then creates the scheduler and the stage. It initializes 
  the scheduler with the number of phases, or different classes of objects, it 
  needs to schedule each cycle. (&quot;Using the Magic Lantern Scheduler&quot; 
  for more information on the scheduler.) </p>
<p>There are different types of stages. On the Windows platform, you can create 
  an Inventor or BRender stage, both written in C++. You can optionally create 
  other managers, such as mouse and keyboard input managers. (See &quot;Handling 
  Input and Output&quot; for more information on input managers.) <em>InitEnv()</em> 
  also initializes the quit variable that is within the Title global structure 
  to false so that the user can exit the title main loop. Finally, it loads the 
  boot scene from the Playprint. This is the first scene of the title, and it 
  appears when Magic Lantern launches the title. </p>
<p>The <em>InitEnv()</em> code segment that follows creates a BRender stage. It 
  also creates a poll-driven keyboard input manager. </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
        // Initialize the scheduler.
        theTitle-&gt;scheduler = new MleScheduler(NUM_PHASES, NUM_FUNCS);
        // Create the stage.
        MleBRenderStage *stage = new MleBRenderStage;
        // Initialize the keyboard input device.
        new MleKeyboardPolled;
        // Initialize the quit variable to false.
        theTitle-&gt;quit = FALSE;
        // Load the boot groups.
        (void) mlLoadBootScene();
        return TRUE;
    }
</pre>
<h4>3.5.1.2.5 Executing the Main Loop<a name="section_3.5.1.2.5"></a></h4>
<p> The <em>MainLoop()</em> function, which takes no arguments, is the title-specific 
  main loop function. Its role is to cycle through the scheduler phases until 
  the quit flag is set to true. </p>
<p><em>MainLoop</em>() looks for event occurrences and calls the scheduler function 
  go for each of the scheduler phases. The four phases shown in Example 1-4 are 
  the required default phases. </p>
<p>Example 1-4: MainLoop </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    int MainLoop(void);
    {
        // Loop forever.
        while (1) {
		    // Execute Actor phase.
            theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_ACTOR);
			// Execute Role phase.
            theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_ROLE);
			// Execute Set phase.
            theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_SET);
			// Execute Stage phase.
            theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_STAGE);
			
			// Check for the exit key.
            if (MleKeyboardPolled::keyboardManager-&gt;keyDown(MLE_KEY_Q))
                theTitle-&gt;quit = TRUE;

            // Check for request to quit title.
            if (theTitle-&gt;quit)
                 break;
        }
        return 0;
    }
 </pre>
<p>If you create a custom phase, such as a global clock update phase or a collision 
  detection phase, then you must add your phase to the MainLoop. For example, 
  if you add a collision detection phase, and you want collision detection to 
  take place immediately after the actor phase, you might add a line such as the 
  following between the actor and role phases: </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    ...
    theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_ACTOR);
    theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_COLLISION_DETECTION);
    theTitle-&gt;scheduler-&gt;go(PHASE_ROLE);
    ...
</pre>
<h4>3.5.1.2.6 Exiting the Title<a name="section_3.5.1.2.6"></a></h4>
<p> Use the <em>CleanupEnv()</em> function to reverse what <em>InitEnv()</em> 
  set up. <em>CleanupEnv()</em> deletes the scheduler, any managers that were 
  created, and deallocates memory. </p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    MlBoolean CleanupEnv(void);
    {
        return TRUE;
    }
</pre>
<h4>3.5.1.3 Using the Magic Lantern Scheduler<a name="section_3.5.1.3"></a></h4>
<p> The Magic Lantern scheduler organizes the rendering sequence of the title 
  within a single frame of real time. It is strictly a sequential process. To 
  use the scheduler, you need to understand the scheduler phases and its functions. 
</p>
<h5>3.5.1.3.1 Scheduler Phases<a name="section_3.5.1.3.1"></a></h5>
<p> There are four distinct steps or phases that occur on each frame when a title 
  plays. The scheduler starts each of these steps, in the following order: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Actor Phase</strong> - The first step is to perform the simulation 
    calculations for the game/title logic. The actor code performs these calculations 
    and maintains the resulting values.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Phase</strong> - The second step involves changing the state 
    of the models that represent the actors. The role code maintains the state 
    of the models. This step initializes or sets the data values to represent 
    the calculated simulation. This is done for both the rendering and sound libraries. 
    In other words, this translates calculations to actual pixels, coordinate 
    values, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Set Phase</strong> - The third step, the set phase, renders the 
    title to the screen. It is the set that plays sounds, draws characters, and 
    so on. Every actor and role must be part of a set. The set organizes roles 
    for presentation, and is thus a view of a set of actors.</li>
  <li><strong>Stage Phase</strong> - The fourth step entails scheduling when each 
    set does its rendering. The stage coordinates access to the shared resources, 
    such as the rendering buffer. All sets render to the same shared buffer. The 
    stage pushes the buffer to the screen display and initializes it to blank 
    for the next frame rendering. </li>
</ul>
<p>The scheduler uses these Magic Lanetern constants to refer to the phases, as 
  follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>PHASE_ACTOR - the actor phase </li>
  <li>PHASE_ROLE - the role phase </li>
  <li>PHASE_SET - the set phase </li>
  <li>PHASE_STAGE - the stage phase </li>
</ul>
<p>To use the Magic Lantern scheduler, a title sets up the set to schedule itself. 
  Most actor and role programmers do not have to include code to schedule a set, 
  because this is done for you by the stage. When you create a set, it is added 
  to the stage and the stage then schedules the set for execution. </p>
<p>The order that sets appear in the DWP determines the order of rendering. You 
  can intermix 2D and 3D sets within the DWP. For example, you can have a 2D set 
  first to display background, then a 3D set for animation, and lastly another 
  2D set for a control panel. In this way, you draw the background first, then 
  the animation on top of the background, and then the control panel on top of 
  the animation. </p>
<p>The stage phase renders the sets. The stage phase draws first the set that 
  appears first in the DWP. When the stage draws the set, the set begins drawing 
  its images based on its linked list. The stage draws last the last set listed 
  in the DWP. The last set is displayed on top of the other sets. </p>
<h5>3.5.1.3.2 Scheduler Functions<a name="section_3.5.1.3.2"></a></h5>
<p> The class <em><strong>MleScheduler</strong></em> defines the API for the Magic 
  Lantern scheduler. Example 1-5 lists these functions. </p>
<p>Example 1-5: MleScheduler Functions</p>
<pre id="cppexample">
    MleScheduler(unsigned int phases, unsigned int items);
    ~MleScheduler();
    void go(unsigned int phase);
    MleSchedulerItem* insertFunc(unsigned int phase,
        void (*func)(void*),
        void* data,
        void* tag,
        unsigned int interval =1,
        unsigned int firstInterval = 1);
    void remove(MleSchedulerItem* item);
    void remove(void* tag);
</pre>
<p> When you use the constructor function <em><strong>MleScheduler()</strong></em> 
  to create a new scheduler for your title, you specify two things: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <em>phases</em> indicates the number of phases that this instance of the 
    scheduler will have </li>
  <li><em>items</em> indicates the number of routines or functions that this scheduler 
    might use </li>
</ol>
<p>Each actor, role, set, or stage (that is, each object) in a MagicLantern title 
  must have a call to the scheduler's <em>insertFunc()</em> routine. <em>insertFunc()</em> 
  creates a hook for every actor, role, set, or stage that calls it. The scheduler 
  uses this hook to call the Magic Lantern object during the appropriate phase. 
  The Magic Lantern object uses <em>insertFunc()</em> to tell the scheduler what 
  function the scheduler should call on this object and the phase it should be 
  called in. The scheduler adds the object's function to its list of functions 
  that it calls for the specified phase. </p>
<p>Note: The maximum number of functions that you can insert into the scheduler's 
  list is determined by the items parameter in the scheduler constructor. </p>
<p>The order in which you insert functions for a phase determines the order that 
  the scheduler calls these functions for that phase. You can control this insertion 
  order by the ordering of functions in the DWP. However, you cannot change the 
  scheduler's order of functions to call during a phase once they have been inserted. 
</p>
<p><em>insertFunc()</em> requires, as parameters, the scheduler phase in which 
  to call your object's function and a pointer to the function. You also designate 
  a reference to data to pass to your function. The <em>tag</em> parameter lets 
  you specify that, when Magic Lantern deletes the object, it should delete all 
  functions associated to the object. Use the <em>interval</em> parameter to specify 
  how often this function should be called, every frame, every other frame, and 
  so on. <em>interval</em> specifies the number of frames between calls to this 
  function. When you set <em>interval</em> to one, the function is called every 
  frame; when you set it to two, it is called every other frame. <em>firstInterval</em> 
  specifies the first frame to call the function. </p>
<p>The <em>go</em> function executes each designated phase. <em>go</em> takes 
  as a parameter the name of the phase that it is to execute. The name of the 
  phase is a defined constant. (See &quot;<a href="#section_3.5.1.3.1">Scheduler 
  Phases</a>&quot;) You call the scheduler's <em>go</em> function for each phase 
  to be executed in a frame. This is illustrated in Example 1-4. </p>
<p>The API provides two ways to remove functions from the scheduler. You can use 
  the <em>remove()</em> function and specify the <em><strong>MleSchedulerItem</strong></em> 
  you created with the constructor. This removes just the specified function. 
  Or, you can use <em>remove()</em> with a <em>tag</em> argument and remove all 
  functions associated with <em>tag</em>. </p>
<h5>2.2.3.8.3 Adding and Removing Scheduler Phases<a name="section_2.2.3.8.3"></a></h5>
<p> You can also add your own custom phase to the scheduler. Adding your own phase 
  gives you the ability to do certain functions at particular points, such as 
  collision detection. Add your phase to the scheduler at the point within the 
  scheduler's phase loop so that it will execute at the moment you want it to 
  execute. See &quot;<a href="#section_3.5.1.2.5">Executing the Main Loop</a>&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Be sure and correctly specify the number of phases when you call <em>MleScheduler</em> 
  to create an instance of the scheduler. In addition, you must update the enum 
  in <em>titleenv.h</em> that lists the scheduler phases to include your custom 
  phase. You must also change the scheduler code itself (that is, MainLoop in 
  <em>title.cxx</em>) to add your phase to the scheduler's phase loop. </p>
<p>Note: While you can remove phases from the scheduler, do this with extreme 
  care. </p>
