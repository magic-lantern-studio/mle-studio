<h1>Executing the Title</h1>
<p>This document discusses how to execute a Magic Lantern Title. The first section 
  identifies how to run the title from within the Magic Lantern Studio IDE. The 
  second section discusses how to run the title from the redistributable application 
  bundle (.apk package) on a Android device.</p>
<h2>Executing a Title from the Magic Lantern Studio<a name="Section_31"></a></h2>
<p>After creating a Magic Lantern Project using <em>The Studio</em>, the application 
  developer will wish to execute and test his/her title. This may be done without 
  leaving the IDE. <em>The Studio</em> uses the Eclipse launch configuration mechanism 
  for running a title within the framework of the IDE. A launch configuration 
  is a description of how to launch and execute a program. Launching in Eclipse 
  is closely tied to the infrastructure for debugging, enabling the developer 
  to make the logical progression from running the title to interactively debugging 
  the title.</p>
<h3>Creating a Launch Configuration<a name="Section_311"></a></h3>
<p>A launch configuration is created using an Eclipse wizard. To create a new 
  configuration, use <em><strong>&quot;Run-&gt;Run Configurations...</strong></em>&quot; 
  from the main Eclipse menu bar. This will start the launch configuration wizard 
  dialog (see Figure 3.1)</p>
<p><img src="images/launchConfg1.png" width="800" height="640"> <br>
  Figure 3.1: Magic Studio Launch Configuration Wizard</p>
<p>Select the &quot;<em><strong>Android Application</strong></em>&quot; 
  entry on the left-hand side of the dialog. The entry is highlighted in Figure 
  3.1.</p>
<p>Next press the 'New' button to create a configuration of the selected type. 
  Doing so will create a new launch configuration for executing your title. Figure 
  3.2 shows an example the new configuration.</p>

  Figure 3.2: Launch Configuration for HelloAndroid Title</p>
<p>If you are following along in the &quot;<em><a href="gettingStarted.html">Magic 
  Lantern Quick Start Guide</a></em>&quot;, creating your first title using the 
  HelloWorld default template, then fill in the information for launching your title. 
  Type in the &quot;<em>Name</em>&quot; of your launch configuration (i.e. <em><strong>HelloWorld</strong></em>), 
  and the <em>Project</em> (i.e <em><strong>HelloWorld</strong></em>).</p>
<p>If you choose to <em><strong>Run</strong></em> the application at this time, 
  then you may not see the application run successfully because you have not yet created
  a Android target device. To create a Android device, follow the instructions outlined
  in <a href="createAndroidDevice.html">Creating a Android Device</a></p>
<p>To specify the Android target device (once it has been created),
  select the &quot;<em><strong>Target</strong></em>&quot; tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/launchConfg3.png" width="829" height="780"><br>
  Figure 3.3: Deployment Target Selection Mode</p>
<p>Select your target device. Select &quot;<em><strong>Automatic</strong></em>&quot;
  if it isn't already selected. Then select a preferred Android Virtual Device for deployment.
  Figure 3.3 shows the <em>mleTarget</em> AVD selected for the 2.3.3 platform.
  Select &quot;Apply&quot; to finalize your configuration.</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;<em><strong>Run</strong></em>&quot; will now launch your application 
  title. It should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/helloWorld.png" width="968" height="899"><br>
  Figure 3.4: HelloWorld Title Execution</p>
<p>The default template will not display the "Hello World!" string. The default template does not
   provide any Actors, so the display will be a blank screen. Figure 3.4 is displaying the result
   of using the HelloWorld Sample application.
<h3>Stopping Title Execution<a name="Section_312"></a></h3>
<p>There are several ways to stop the title. Since the title is running on the Android emulator, 
  you can simply select the Close button (<strong>'X'</strong>) in the emulator 
  window. Another way to stop title execution is to use the DDMS perspective.</p>
<p>To stop title execution using the Android DDMS perspective, do 
  the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the DDMS perspecitve. Select &quot;<strong><em>Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;DDMS</em></strong>&quot; 
    from the main Eclipse menu bar.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If the title is currently running then you should see something like Figure 
    3.6 in the upper left-hand corner of the DDMS perspective. Figure 3.6 shows 
    the <em>HelloAndroid</em> title process running. The red stop sign may be used 
    to terminate the process.<br>

<h2>Executing a Title from the Title Application Bundle<a name="Section_32"></a></h2>
<p>The Title Application Bundle is a redistributable <em>.apk</em> archive. 
  To run the HelloWorld title from the application bundle, the following steps 
  should be taken:</p>
